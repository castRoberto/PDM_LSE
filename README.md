# [PDM] Practice 2, Non-blocking delays.

## Description

In this practice, functions are implemented to manage non-blocking delays, as well as an example managing multiple LEDs with different oscillation periods.


# [PDM] Practice 3, Modularization

Practice related to the modularization of functions that control non-blocking delays.

## Description

A package called API is created that contains the header and implementation files for the API_delay module. Calls are redirected to this new module. The concept of encapsulation is also used by limiting the scope with the static modifier of a new function called isTimeOut.
